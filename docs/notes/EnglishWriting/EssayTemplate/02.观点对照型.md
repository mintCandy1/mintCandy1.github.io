<p style="textAlign: center;"><b>Should Parents Send Their Kids to Art Classes?</b></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, there has been a wave of sending children to various art classes, where the kids are expected to learn how to paint, dance, sing or play musical instruments. However, people's opinions vary on this issue.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people firmly support that. Since the competition among the kids for places in famous primary schools and middle schools is fierce, they see an artistic talent of the kids as an extra advantage in the competition. Furthermore, they claim, even if the kids do not do well in art, the art learning experience may prove useful for their furture life. However, others seriously doubt this. They complain that, for those kids who do well in art, art classes have taken up so much of their leisure time that many are leading a vary stressful childhood. For those who have no interest in such classes, they are just a waste of time.

&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinions, parents should encourage their kids to take art classes but at the same time have an open mind about this issue. If the kid is keen on art, art classes are sure to be the first choice. But if the kid hates it, he should not be forced to take them.
