<p style="textAlign: center;"><b>Due Attention Should Be Given to the Study of Chinese</b></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, while an increasing number of people are busy learning foreign languages, the attention to the study of the ==mother tongue== is on the decline. Should such a trend continue, it would definitely lead to an undesirable result in the long run.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason of our ignorance of the study of Chinese are obvious. **Firstly**, globalization plays a major role in the prevalence of the nowadays internationally used language -- English, distracting us from studying our own language. Among college students, the influence of western lifestyle is especially strong -- the young are either not interested or even have no time to care for our own culture, let alone the language. **Secondly**, our schools are not attaching any importance to the education of Chinese. The lesson hours of Chinese are far fewer than those of English, and English has now even crowded into the teaching syllabus of primary schools, occupying the time that pupills should otherwise spend studying Chinese.

&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to change the situation, efforts from govemments and schools alike should be made. More Chinese lessons are essential, and even more importantly, students' awareness of the study of our own language should be raised. After all, the promotion of our language is the key to the prosperity of our nation's culture.
